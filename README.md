# us-states-game
 Using Python and some of its libraries like the Turtle module and Pandas, replicate this game from https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states. The goal of the game is to remember as many states as possible. There is a map of the USA with empty states, and every time we correctly input the name of a state, we earn 1 point and the state gets labeled.
